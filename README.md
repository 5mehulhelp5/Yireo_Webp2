# Magento 2 module for WebP
This module adds WebP support to Magento 2. Currently, it ships with the following features:

- Browser-support for WebP is detected in various ways: A simple check for Chrome, an ACCEPT header sent by the browser and a JavaScript check generating a `webp` cookie for all browsers that remain.
- When `<img>` tags are found on the page, the corresponding JPG or PNG is converted into WebP and a corresponding `<picture` tag is used to replace the original `<img>` tag.
- For the default Magento 2 product gallery (Fotorama), the WebP images are replaced. Please note that this is NOT compatible with the Full Page Cache!

### System requirements
Make sure your PHP environment supports WebP: This means that the function `imagewebp` should exist in PHP. We hope to add more checks for this in the extension itself soon. For now, just open up a PHP `phpinfo()` page and check for WebP support.

An alternative is that the `cwebp` binary from the WebP project is uploaded to your server and placed in a generic folder like `/usr/local/bin`.

Please note that both tasks should be simple for developers and system administrator, but might be magical for non-technical people. If this extension is not working out of the box for you, most likely a technical person needs to take a look at your hosting environment.

### Instructions for using composer
Use composer to install this extension. First make sure that Magento is installed via composer, and that there is a valid `composer.json` file present.

Next, install our module using the following command:

    composer require yireo/magento2-webp2

Next, install the new module into Magento itself:

    ./bin/magento module:enable Yireo_WebP2
    ./bin/magento setup:upgrade

Enable the module by toggling the setting in **Stores > Configuration > Advanced > System > Yireo WebP > Enabled**.

Done.

### FAQ
#### How do I know WebP is used?
Make sure to test things with the obvious caches disabled (Full Page Cache, Block HTML Cache). Once this extension is working, catalog images (like on a category page) should be replaced with: Their `<img>` tag should be replaced with a `<picture>` tag that lists both the old image and the new WebP image. If the conversion from the old image to WebP goes well.

#### After installation, I'm still seeing only PNG and JPEG images
This could mean that the conversion failed. New WebP images are stored in the same path as the original path (somewhere in `pub/`) which means that all folders need to be writable by the webserver. Specifically, if your deployment is based on artifacts, this could be an issue.

Also make sure that your PHP environment is capable of WebP: The function `imagewebp` should exist in PHP and we recommend a `cwebp` binary to be placed in `/usr/local/bin/`.

Last but not least, WebP images only work in WebP-capable browsers. The extension detects the browser support. Make sure to test this in Chrome first, which natively supports WebP.

#### Some of the images are convered, but others are not.
Not all JPEG and PNG images are fit for conversion to WebP. In the past, WebP has had issues with alpha-transparency and partial transparency. If the WebP image can't be generated by our extension, it is not generated. Simple as that. If some images are converted but some are not, try to upload those to online conversion tools to see if they work.

Make sure your `cwebp` binary and PHP environment are up-to-date.
